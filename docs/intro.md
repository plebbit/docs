# Welcome to Plebbit

## Description
Plebbit is serverless, admin-less, decentralized Reddit alternative built completely with IPFS/IPNS/pubsub. It doesn't use any central server, central database, public HTTP endpoint or DNS, it is pure peer to peer. It is fully open source under the license of GPL V2

## Key Features

- P2P means the more people that use it the faster it gets (doesn't have scaling issues like blockchain-based social media protocols)
- [Ability to set custom challenges for users to interact with your community](./local-node/challenges)
- Permissionless protocol means anyone can write their custom frontend and extend the utility of existing frontends ([seedit](./frontends/seedit.md), [plebchan](./frontends/plebchan.md))
- Having full ownership of your community means you can run it however you want, including [monetizing it](./local-node/monetizing-your-sub.md)
- Running a full node takes a few seconds, since there is no blockchain to sync
