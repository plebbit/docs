# Anti-Spam Challenges

## Overview

Plebbit's anti-spam challenge system is a core innovation that allows communities to implement custom verification mechanisms for user interactions. These challenges are fully arbitrary and can be customized to any programmable verification method.

## How Challenges Work

1. When a user attempts to interact with a community (post, comment, vote, etc.), they receive a challenge from the community's node
2. The challenge is delivered peer-to-peer, without any central server
3. The user's client must complete the challenge successfully to have their interaction accepted
4. The community owner can customize these challenges to their specific needs

## Types of Challenges

Challenges can be virtually anything that can be programmed, including:

### Proof of Work
- CPU-based challenges
- Memory-hard algorithms
- Custom mining algorithms

### Identity Verification
- Password protection
- SMS verification
- Biometric verification
- OAuth integration

### Community-Based
- Karma requirements
- Account age verification
- Previous participation metrics

### Economic
- Token holdings
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Staking requirements

## Implementing Challenges

Community owners can implement challenges by:

1. Selecting or creating challenge types
2. Setting difficulty levels
3. Defining verification parameters
4. Implementing response validation

## Security Considerations

- Challenges should be computationally verifiable
- Implementation should be resistant to replay attacks
- Consider the balance between security and user experience
- Regular updates to challenge parameters may be necessary
